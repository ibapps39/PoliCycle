# README.md
## What is this?
- This project's goal is to take some 99% percent of A.I. generated code and make the best of it that I can and develop it further. As for what <i>exactly</i> this is, I mean for it to be very small political economy management and simulation game.
    - Note: The original and modified code will be/are in a separate folders.
    - My goal is to get something working, feels like mine, optimized, and if time permits even have it profiled and have unit tests.
## Additional Explanation
- <i>Why this?</i> 
    - Well, as A.I. as developes and gets adopted by developers, studios, and employers, I believe it to be important that we make the best of it we can, develop our abilities to use it as a tool to improve productivity, and in this case even help practice with adapting and reading work that isn't our own. This isn't a perfect project, but I do hope and think it's enough to learn and push myself.

- <i>Is this vibe coding/coded?</i>
    - It is <b>not</b> <i>vibe coding</i>, as I do not intend to use any additionally A.I. generated code, as in general while A.I. can and is a great tool for developers, the goal of this project is to push my own development abilities and further simulate working on another persons, a greater project, and etc. 
    - Additionally, while I'm not sure I can say I am 100% a C++ dev., as I tend to prefer C and therefore default to, <i>C-style</i> C++, my hope to also push my abilities in that regard as well.
- <i>Is this a full game</i>
    - This isn't a full game and likely won't be. While I do and have pursued doing something similar, a version that I'd be remotely be satisfied with would likely take far more time and resources than I have at the moment.
- <i>Is it open source?</i> 
    - As of Mar. 22nd, 2025, it is source visible and will remain so regardless of completion. 
    - It's often a plus if a developer has projects that others use and/or have made contributions to an open source project, but more importantly, one that some or many people use. This isn't and likely won't be.
        - That said, if that changes, I'm open to it.
- <i>Is there other documentation?</i> 
    - I hope and am considering documenting my time doing this for both accountability, evidence, and fun! If I have and do, I will provide links.
- <b><i>99%?</i></b> A.I. developed? 
    - Yeah, I made some very minute changes to the code (mainly the file structure and manipulating one of the <i>entities</i>/bubbles behaviors but it was literally one line). But other than that it's been untouched.
- <i>Why raylib?</i> 
    - I like raylib as a library that's not too high level but also more than just a window management tool. 
    - While I have and do like sdl/2 for other things where I want more control over my rendering backend and cross-compatibility, raylib is enough for something of this scope.
